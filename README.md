## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**DreamAnchor/DreamAnchor** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... coding my first Adobe Photoshop Panel
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... how
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... nothing
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... not sure
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... my mental health
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ... please don't
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ... just don't call me late for dinner
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... most people don't find facts fun, and those who do aren't typically very fun for those who don't. Fact: That was an opinion with only the factual evidence proliferated by the anecdotes of my life history. Yes that was likely redundant. Have fun.

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**DreamAnchor/DreamAnchor** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

## Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on...** coding my first Adobe Photoshop Panel. Yes, this might take a while. 
- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning...** how. Yes, just... *how*.
- ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on...** nothing. I work alone, like a coding ninja in the night (who maybe naps a lot).
- ðŸ¤” **Iâ€™m looking for help with...** not sure. I'll get back to you on that. Or not.
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about...** my mental health. It's a rollercoaster, so hold on tight.
- ðŸ“« **How to reach me:** ... please don't. The inbox monster is real.
- ðŸ˜„ **Pronouns:** ... just don't call me late for dinner. Seriously, I get *hangry*.
- âš¡ **Fun fact:** ... Most people don't find facts fun, and those who do aren't typically much fun for those who don't. Fact: That was an opinion supported by the anecdotal evidence of my life. Was that redundant? Probably. Are you having fun yet?

Enjoy your stay in this repository, or don't â€“ I'm not here to tell you how to live your life.
